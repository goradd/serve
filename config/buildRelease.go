// The Release constant is used throughout the framework to determine if we are running the development version
// or release version of the product. The development version is designed to make on-going development easier,
// and the release version is designed to run on a deployment server.
// It is off by default, but you can turn it on by building with the -tags "release" flag.
// Combine with the nodebug tag like so: go build -tags "release nodebug"
// You might build a release version that keeps the debug features on if you are building for manual testers
